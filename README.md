# KryptoSolver
An F# implementation that finds solutions to the Krypto mathematical card game.
Years ago, okay... a 'decade plus' years ago... I wrote this in Basic as a fun project because my daughter was
bringing home homework each week with a Krypto to be solved.

Recently (Oct 2015) A co-worker introduced me to F#, I was instantly intrigued, and wanted an F# project to cut my teeth on.

This is it!

A quick explanation of Krypto:
  Five cards that contain a number (usually 1 to 25) are placed on the table to represent the Operands of an equation.  
  A sixth card is placed on the table to represent the desired result of the equation.
  Objective of the game:
  - Rearrange the Operands with any combination of standard mathematics Operators (plus, minus, times, and divide) so that the Equation evaluates to the Solution card.
